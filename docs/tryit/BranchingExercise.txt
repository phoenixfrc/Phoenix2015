I Start a new test project for branch experiments

  1. Be sure to be in the C++ perspective (click on icon in top right if not)
  2. For this example I am using "Getting started" for the new project, but you can name it something else
  3. File->New->project
       example robot c++  (next)
       Getting Started    (finish) 

II use Eclipse to create a git repo for the new project

  1. Switch to Git perspective
  2. You should already have the team project Phoenix2015 listed here,
      It will show you the path to your workspace, so take a note of it
      (Something like c:\Users\yourUsername\workspace\ )
  3. In top right of the left panel (Git Repositories) there are a set of icons.
     There are three with Git in words with a yellow disk.
     Choose the rightmost of the three git icons (Create a new git repository and add it to this view)
     
     3a - using the path from step 2 browse to the project directory from part I
     3b - highlight the project folder (Getting Started) and click OK
     3c - click finish

III make an initial commit

  1. Switch to the C++ perspective
  2. Use your OS to copy the .gitignore file from the Phoenix2015 project into the new 
     project (Getting started) (You should overwrite the one that might be there already)
  3. Open the src folder and right click Robot.cpp -> Team -> Add to index
  4. Show the hidden .gitignore (and oter . files) in the project
     In the project explorer pane (left side of c++ perspective)
     Highlight project (Getting Started)
     Click down arrow icon (menu icon)
     Choose Customize view
     On filters tab uncheck the  .*resources choice (OK)
  5. add the .gitignore file to index (like in step 3)
  6. Right click the project and choose Team-> Commit
        Should see .gitignore and src/Robot.cpp
	enter "First commit" into message area  (COMMIT)
	(Note, you can't push since there is no upstream repo we just made one for this experiment)

IV make a second commit
  1. open Robot.cpp
  2. add a comment like this:

  /*
   * First change by yourname to test branch
   */
  3. save, add and commit the Robot.cpp file.  
     a> rightclick on robot.cpp, commit...
     b> keep src/Robot.cpp selected.
     c> add message.  (First change)  (COMMIT)
  4. Observe commit history in eclipse via
     Right click on project (Getting Started) -> Team -> Show in history
